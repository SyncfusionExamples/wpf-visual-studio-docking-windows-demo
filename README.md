# Visual Studio-like Docking Windows Demo for WPF
This sample demonstrates how to create a Visual Studio-like docking layout in a WPF application using Syncfusion’s DockingManager control. It showcases how developers can organize multiple tool windows—such as Solution Explorer, Properties, and Output—into a flexible, interactive workspace that supports docking, floating, tab grouping, and auto-hide behavior.
The layout mimics the familiar Visual Studio interface, allowing users to drag and drop panels to customize their workspace. It also includes built-in support for layout persistence through serialization, so users can save and restore their preferred configurations.
In addition to layout functionality, this sample applies a Visual Studio-like theme to enhance the overall look and feel. It serves as a practical reference for building modern, user-friendly WPF applications with dynamic panel management.
